## What about parking?
Parking in most University of Oregon parking lots will be free for the day of the conference (given it's a Sunday). Please see the PDF map <a href = "https://business.uoregon.edu/sites/business1.uoregon.edu/files/media/campus-parking-map.pdf"> here </a> for a list of parking lots and their relation to the EMU. 

Metered parking is also generally free on Sunday, and the spots on University Street near McArthur court would be a good spot to look first. Lots 18, 17, and 16A are good alternatives.
