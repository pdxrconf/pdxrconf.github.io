Cascadia R Conference is an R conference serving the Pacific Northwest region (Oregon/Washington/BC).

The conference first started in 2017, 
and will be returning for another virtual conference in 2022.
See you there!

We wanted to run this event as there are relatively few R conferences. In addition, 
the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/">Portland R User Group</a>
is quite active, but it is hard to get together with folks from nearby cities like
Corvallis/Eugene/Seattle/etc. This event is a place to come together around R,
but also an excuse to get together with like minded people across
a larger part of the Pacific Northwest.
