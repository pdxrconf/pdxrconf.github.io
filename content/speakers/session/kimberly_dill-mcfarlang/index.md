The grammar of graphics is an immensely powerful structure utilizing a building block approach for data visualization. This grammar is implemented in R through the ggplot2 package where users can create plots from simple bars to complex, multi-panel models. Additional functionalities have been added over the years, but many custom needs are outside the scope of a single package. Here, I give an overview of packages useful in customizing and expanding ggplot2 figures. This includes functions to readably label points, annotate statistical tests, customize facets, plot unusual biological data, and more. You will see both the underlying code and resulting plots so that you can apply these techniques in your own work.

__Bio:__ Dr. Kim Dill-McFarland is a bioinformatician at the U. of Washington. She works at the intersection of microbiology and computer science, applying computational approaches to biological problems. Using sequencing and other high-throughput techniques, she works with several UW labs to research how the human immune system responds to disease.
