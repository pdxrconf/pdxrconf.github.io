The AD Knowledge Portal has data on over 25,000 specimens from nearly 8,000 subjects, with more data coming in monthly, from Alzheimer Disease researchers spread across the globe. In order to collate this data into useable, coherent datasets suitable for secondary research, our team needed a flexible, adaptable, long-term solution to common data curation problems. We developed a set of customizable, reusable Shiny applications, dccvalidator and dccmonitor. dccvalidator is capable of finding recurring curation problems and puts the initial curation process in the hands of those who know the data best: data contributors. The sister application, dccmonitor, gives curators a dashboard to view contributor progress and find the challenging problems that are unable to be automatically detected. Together, these applications have streamlined the curation process so much so that other teams have launched their own versions of these applications, customized to their data needs. Check out this talk to find out how the design of these applications have led them, and their underlying ideas, to spread through our organization.

__Bio:__ Nicole originally earned an undergrad degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington, with the intent to design and build medical devices. However, Nicole realized that her dream career was at the intersection of engineering, medical research, and software -- not hardware. Nicole went on to earn a Masters in Computer Science and Systems, with a focus on Bioinformatics, at the University of Washington - Tacoma. Nicole now works as a Bioinformatics Engineer in the Systems Biology Infrastructure team at Sage Bionetworks, a health research nonprofit. During business hours, she spends her time building software solutions that help researchers share their data in a way that makes it easy for others to find, learn about, download, and reuse. When Nicole isn't working, she is living life; she's a maker, a hiker, a reader, and a gamer.
