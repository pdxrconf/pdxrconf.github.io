Professional football players fulfill various roles within their respective teams, like a reliable central defender or an elite goal scorer. If the tools used by the Vancouver Whitecaps' Data Science Department formed a team, R would be the ultimate 'utility player', the generalist that could be asked to play multiple roles depending on what the team needs. One clear example of how R fulfills these different roles within our sporting environment can be seen in how we collect, integrate, aggregate, and communicate data collected from PlayerMaker devices – two small accelerometers worn in rubber straps attached around a player’s left and right boot). These devices are worn by all of our academy players, across 5 teams, during training every training session and match. In this talk, I will describe how R is deployed across our data pipeline daily in this specific use case with the Vancouver Whitecaps Football Club, so that the data we collect every day with dozens of academy players can be communicated effectively and reliably to coaches, performance department practitioners, and the players themselves. From a data processing standpoint – we download 3 separate Excel files from each training session (15 files a day), with different levels of information and varying levels of cleaning/processing required. I will describe which packages we use to process these files – ensure that the links between raw velocity traces or possession files are connected to summary data from each drill/session. From a data communication standpoint, we believe that context is key, but privacy is preeminent. Therefore, while we want to give data back to our players so they can better understand and learn from it, we must ensure that they receive only their own information in an identifiable way. I will describe how we accomplish these two objectives through generating player-specific reports as ggplot2 images, and send individual emails to each player on a weekly basis with these reports attached inline. Technology, however fancy it may be, is useless in isolation and if it does not alter practice or inform decision making. Therefore, ensuring that the data provided by any given technology can be integrated within an organization’s systems and communicated clearly to the individuals who need it is vital for success. Accomplishing this process at the Vancouver Whitecaps FC – as demonstrated in our PlayerMaker example – is made possible by one of our favourite data science department tools – R. 

__Bio:__ Johann Windt is the Head of Data Science – Performance with the Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). His stated objective is to make everyone else's job easier and more efficient by overseeing data collection, integration and reporting across football operations - including Scouting & Recruitment, Sport Science & Medicine, Player Development, and First Team Football. Prior to his time with the Whitecaps, Johann worked as a sports medicine data analyst in Colorado Springs with the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee. Academically, his PhD work involved intensive longitudinal data from player tracking technology, and how to conceptually and analytically examine how training data relates to athletes' health and performance. His research and professional interests include how technology and data science can inform organizational decision-making. An avid R user in his academic and applied worlds, he has rarely went throughout a major project without spinning up a fresh RStudio session.
