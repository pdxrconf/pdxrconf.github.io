Computer scientist Phil Karlton once famously noted “There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” I don’t know what cache invalidation is, and neither you nor I probably identify as computer scientists, but naming things sure is hard. This talk explores the challenge of naming things in R well, not only as an aesthetic problem but also a technical one. Using packages in the {tidymodels} ecosystem as a case study, I will demonstrate some considerations that R users and package developers ought to keep in mind when naming functions and other objects in R to make our work more inclusive, interpretable, and effective.

__Bio:__ Simon Couch is a developer on open source R packages for statistical modeling such as {broom}, {infer}, and {stacks}. He recently completed his undergraduate degree in Mathematical Statistics at Reed College and is a former RStudio intern. This fall, he will be beginning his PhD in Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. His R package {stacks}, from which his Cascadia R Conference talk was inspired, was awarded the 2021 John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award.
