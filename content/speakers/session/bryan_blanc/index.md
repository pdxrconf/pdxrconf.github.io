session: "Shiny and R"

Buses are the backbone of most urban transit systems – they are where transit agencies invest the most service hours, have the most flexibility in their systems, but are also the most susceptible to the constraints and congestion on urban surface streets. Using R, we analyzed high resolution GPS and passenger count data to understand bus transit delay, and aggregated this information to a custom geometric representation of King County Metro’s bus network. We then used Shiny to develop an interactive dashboard that planners and analysts could use to view the data at both systemwide and location specific levels. Additionally, we developed a module of the application that enables the development of projects and scenarios with an associated forecast of delay reduction. Using these features, the agency could both understand existing sources and locations of transit delay and sketch solutions for addressing delay very quickly. We will present an overview of the data aggregation process, and then demonstrate the dashboard, highlighting what packages were used in development and what components had to be developed custom for the application.  

__Bio:__ Bryan is a transportation planner/data scientist at Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates, a transportation planning consulting firm. He has been an R user since he started using R in graduate school at Portland State University in 2013 both for coursework and academic research.  Shortly after graduating with an M.S. in 2015, Bryan joined Nelson\Nygaard, and has supported a wide variety of transportation planning efforts including bus transit plans, parking supply management analyses, active transportation safety analyses, commuter travel surveys, and others. Throughout that time, he has used R to support his transportation planning work, and is now focused on using R and other data science tools and skills to support his colleagues and their clients. In consultation with TriMet (Portland’s transit agency) and Metro (the Portland area’s regional government), Bryan developed the analysis framework underlying the initial iteration of the Bus Delay Analysis Tool (BDAT, a shiny dashboard tool to be presented) developed to support their bus transit project prioritization in 2019-2020. Since then, Bryan has worked with Esther Needham (his co-presenter) and other members of the Nelson\Nygaard team to develop further iterations of BDAT for other transit agencies, including King County Metro (Seattle, WA) and Regional Transportation District (Denver, CO).
