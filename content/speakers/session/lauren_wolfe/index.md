As COVID-19 was beginning to shut down every major city around the globe, my team was faced with challenges similar to many other groups at the time: a quick transition to remote work, reductions in staffing, and shifting priorities. One of the new  tasks I was assigned included assessing performance of  web properties for our work. I took one look at the Google Analytics dashboard and knew that learning the ins and outs of building reproducible reports using their interface would be a nightmare. And thus, the idea to create my first R package was born. Forged from the fires of depression, existential dread, and overwhelming work responsibilities, this package pulls data from both GitHub and Google Analytics to enable quick and easy reporting in R Markdown. Not all R packages are born from a passion to learn or desire to innovate. Rather, sometimes the motivation to build software feels like pulling teeth, and only exists for the sake of making life a little bit easier. However, after a year of working on this R package my motivations and feelings towards it have begun to shift. What began as a self-serving work project has become an effort to serve the R community. I’ve been able to leverage my experience building my first R package from scratch to create practical introductory R programming materials and I’m truly excited to share this package with a wider audience in the hopes that it could make life a little bit easier for someone else.
