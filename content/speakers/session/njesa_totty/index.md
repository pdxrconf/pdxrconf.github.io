As statistical computing has become an increasingly prevalent component of introductory statistics courses, so too has the use of bootstrapping. While bootstrapping is a powerful tool, it requires that users validate a set of often overlooked, but important, assumptions before the results can be considered valid and trustworthy. We hope to discuss why these overlooked assumptions are so important for valid inferences to be made and introduce a new R package, bootEd. This software package has been designed to help students and teachers of introductory statistics courses implement bootstrap methods easily while also emphasizing the process of assessing the assumptions that are foundational to the efficacy of these methods. We hope that participants will understand that effectively communicating the assumptions behind such methods is a necessary step in the teaching process and become aware of the bootEd package as a tool for accomplishing that goal. As the use of statistics and statistical computing becomes increasingly pertinent to an improved society, more introductory statistics courses are teaching methods such as bootstrapping and more students are taking these courses. Observers of industry and academia can see that statistical computing is catching on in many fields. In order to ensure that popular methods are applied correctly in industry, we must take a good look at how these methods are taught in the classroom. Instructors can select tools like bootEd to ensure that students leave the classroom with the capability to correctly apply these methods.

__Bio:__ Njesa Totty is passionate about all things related to higher education. Upon completing her undergraduate studies in mathematics, with a minor in education, she spent time giving back to her community and teaching math at an inner-city charter school before heading off to graduate school. Currently, she is wrapping up her PhD program in Statistics at Oregon State University (OSU) where she holds a graduate teaching assistant (GTA) position and conducts research pertaining to statistical applications in higher education and statistics education. In her time as a GTA at OSU she has also worked on curriculum development and course reconstruction projects within her department and served as a graduate research assistant for projects pertaining to university student success initiatives. She was awarded the Outstanding GTA Award and is a Southern Regional Education Board Doctoral Scholar. As a current member of the College of Science Student Board of Advisors, she has gained insight into the many issues that higher education institutions may face and is formulating ideas on how these can be solved using statistics and data science. Upon completing her PhD, Njesa desires to work in a faculty position at a university where she can continue to teach and perform her research.
