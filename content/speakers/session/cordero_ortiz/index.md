The Portland, Oregon airshed poses a high public health risk from air toxics due to the city’s population density, development activities, and role as a global freight corridor. PM2.5 is a particularly harmful air toxic composed of a complex mixture of droplets and particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter. With air quality consistently at the forefront of environmental issues affecting urban areas, some companies are producing consumer-grade air quality sensors for measuring ambient particulate matter concentrations. One company, PurpleAir, is unique in that it’s relatively low-cost air quality sensors also record PM2.5 data to a Thingspeak API. The R package AirSensor was written specifically for querying real-time and historical PurpleAir data; however, there are limitations that inhibit simultaneously querying the historical data of multiple sensors. This proposed talk will explore parallelizing API queries of PurpleAir historical data of over 150 sensors in the Portland metro area, utilizing the caret package to train predictive random forest machine learning models of monthly mean PM2.5 concentration, and then packaging the monthly models into a Shiny Dashboard. My initial intention behind this project was to create and share a single predictive PM2.5 random forest model as an interactive tmap web map; however, R allowed me to easily automate API queries and train random forest models for 14 months starting in January 2020. As it turned out, the best way to share these models was with a Shiny Dashboard, through which I was able to incorporate real-time spatial analysis of current and historical PurpleAir data! A couple of bugs in my dashboard have prevented me from publishing it to the web, but I am still able to successfully launch the dashboard  locally on my machine. 

__Bio:__ Cordero Ortiz is a GIS Analyst based in Portland, Oregon, with a background in environmental and atmospheric chemistry. His 2019 thesis at Reed College, Mapping the NOx Plumes of Transportation Infrastructure in Portland, Oregon, sparked his interest in GIS and motivated his enrollment and subsequent completion of the Graduate GIS Certificate Program at Portland State University in the winter of 2021. He currently has a special interest in remote sensing, APIs, machine learning, and dynamic web mapping for Shiny dashboards, all of which he tied together in an aptly titled project, PurpleAir PM2.5 Modeling in Portland, OR. This project encapsulates Cordero’s journey to learn R and wraps the products of several R packages, such as AirSensor, MODISTools, spdep, snow, and caret, into a dynamic air quality Shiny dashboard.
