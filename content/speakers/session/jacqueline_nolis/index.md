Ecommerce has many components that must be securely handled--managing a user's shopping cart, checking out and taking payment, and fulfilling orders. I am excited to say that I've successfully created an ecommerce platform for a side project built _entirely in R with Shiny_. Using the experimental {brochure} package by Colin Fay I was able to make a complex Shiny web service. I integrated Stripe for payments and used Stripe webhooks to know when to fulfill orders. I even used {httr} to make API calls to order the physical products from suppliers after the customer payments are received. In this talk I'll go through the architecture I devised and how you can make an ecommerce platform yourself!
