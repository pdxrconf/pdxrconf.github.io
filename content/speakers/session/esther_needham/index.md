talk: "Using Shiny Dashboards to Understand Bus Transit Delay and Sketch Solutions for King County Metro Transit"
session: "Shiny and R"

Buses are the backbone of most urban transit systems – they are where transit agencies invest the most service hours, have the most flexibility in their systems, but are also the most susceptible to the constraints and congestion on urban surface streets. Using R, we analyzed high resolution GPS and passenger count data to understand bus transit delay, and aggregated this information to a custom geometric representation of King County Metro’s bus network. We then used Shiny to develop an interactive dashboard that planners and analysts could use to view the data at both systemwide and location specific levels. Additionally, we developed a module of the application that enables the development of projects and scenarios with an associated forecast of delay reduction. Using these features, the agency could both understand existing sources and locations of transit delay and sketch solutions for addressing delay very quickly. We will present an overview of the data aggregation process, and then demonstrate the dashboard, highlighting what packages were used in development and what components had to be developed custom for the application.  

__Bio:__ Esther is a transportation planner at Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates, working out of the Portland, Oregon office. Prior to joining Nelson\Nygaard in 2019, Esther worked as a data analyst and project manager at Azavea, a geospatial software development company in Philadelphia, PA. Esther was introduced to R and programming while attending graduate school for city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania in 2014. Since then she has been using R for data analysis with a focus on geospatial analysis, visualizations, and building interactive tools. Since joining Nelson\Nygaard, Esther has focused primarily on transit and active transportation safety analyses and building dashboards using Shiny. She has been working with Bryan Blanc (co-presenter) to further develop the Bus Delay Analysis Tool (BDAT) and implement features that allow users to experiment with treatments to improve bus performance in order to plan for future real-world investments.
