title: "Call for Presentations: Extended to March 22, 2021"
---

It is with great pleasure that we announce the Call for Presentations for the 2021 Cascadia R Conference to be held virtually on June 4-5, 2021.

The goals of the conference are to showcase the interesting ways R is being used in the region, provide learning opportunities, and connect R programmers with one another. The presentations, therefore, are a platform for promoting these ideals. 

The theme of the 2021 conference is “infectious ideas”.  This is purposefully broad to allow a diverse suite of talks.  Some examples of topics that would fit in this theme include:
- Using R for collaborating and communicating with a diverse audience: using blogs/websites, reports, Shiny Dashboards, leaflet maps
- Effective R packages and how you use them in your work: you don’t have to be the author of a package to share how you use it!
- Making the R ecosystem more inclusive: sharing skills, building community
- Using R in education: training in R, or using R to teach non-R concepts
- Spreading R culture in your organization: infusing your colleagues with enthusiasm for R and a culture of sharing

Applicants should note that presentations are being solicited to fill a 15-minute presentation window (15 minutes for talk, with 3 speakers sharing a 15 minute question and answer period to round out an hour-long session). 5 minute lightning talk applications are also being accepted. Student talks will receive special consideration. Our audience is of varying skill level, and from a wide range of organizations: non-profit, academic, government, and industry.  A representative volunteer will be provided the day of the conference to assist with timing, introductions, and facilitate interactions with the audience. Presenters are expected to comply with the <a href="/policies">Code of Conduct</a> of the conference. 

Please note that Cascadia R Conference is a regional conference that focuses on R users from the Cascadia region (primarily Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California). Submissions are welcome from those outside of the region, but priority may be given to submissions from Cascadia locations.

To apply, fill out and submit the <a href="https://forms.gle/y9VRggFfN7B2MfCz9">Cascadia R Conference 2021 talk submission form</a>. Applicants must include an abstract limited to 500 words describing your presentation and how it aligns with the goals of the conference, as well as email contact information. 

The Call for Presentations will open Feb 5, 2021 and will close March 22, 2021. Presenters will be notified by April 1, 2021. Upon notification, presenters are expected to confirm acceptance, provide high quality headshots, and a short biography that will be included on the Cascadia R Conference website. Prior to the conference, copies of final presentation are required to be made available to the planning committee by May 31, 2021. Presenters’ registration fees will be covered after acceptance.
