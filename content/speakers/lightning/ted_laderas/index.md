Fostering a supportive culture in the classroom is not just about instructor behavior. Students need to be supportive of each other as well. In this talk, I talk about a function of the week assignment in our R Programming course that helped students support each other in their learning. Of a list of lesser known `tidyverse` functions deemed highly useful by R users, each student was tasked with learning about a function and presenting an example of how to use it to the other students. Throughout the presentations, fellow students were supportive of each other and grateful for the lessons learned. In the end, the assignment helped students learn more `tidyverse`, and each student generated a document that was shared online. I will end the talk with discussing how to use this assignment in other programming courses. Function presentations can be viewed here: https://sph-r-programming.netlify.app/functions/
