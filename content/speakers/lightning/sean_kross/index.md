Modern professional identities are scattered all over the web, split between several profiles, repositories, and applications. Professional networking sites aim to solve this issue, however they often try to lock their usersâ€™ data into their ecosystem while also monetizing that data through methods that can be problematic. In a reaction against social and professional networking sites, people often create and host their own websites. However, creating a personal website comes with other costs, including the need to learn and maintain new technologies. To address these issues, the Postcards package is designed to allow people who are already comfortable with R Markdown to create a personal or project website from a single R Markdown document. In this lightning talk I will demonstrate how to create and deploy a Postcards website for free in less than five minutes.
