Have you ever found yourself asking “What does this mean?” or “How did I do that?” when it comes time to reproduce your weekly, monthly, or annual report(s)? If so, taking a closer look at your current workflow may help identify areas that too time-consuming. With data science techniques in mind, this talk demonstrates how you can use R to redesign a workflow to become more efficient, consistent, and reproducible. Using features available in RStudio and R packages like {dbplyr}, {bookdown}, and {janitor} you will learn tools to apply to your current workflow.
