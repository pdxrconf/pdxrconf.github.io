      <h2>Alison Hill</h2>

      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Big Magic with R: Creative Learning Beyond Fear</p>
      <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Alison is an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Oregon Health Science University (OHSU) and the Assistant Director of OHSU's Center for Spoken Language Understanding, home to the Computer Science graduate education program. Her current research aims to evaluate whether Natural Language Processing methods can be translated into meaningful outcome measures for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders like Autism, Down Syndrome, and Fragile X Syndrome. Her work has been published in numerous peer-reviewed journals and book chapters, and has been funded by the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on Women's Health, and the National Institute on Deafness &amp; Other Communication Disorders. Alison began using and teaching R seven years ago. She teaches four graduate-level courses using R, and is the author of "Working with Data in the Tidyverse" to be offered by DataCamp.com. She is also a co-author of the book "blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown" with Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas.</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inspired by the book "Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear" by Elizabeth Gilbert, Alison will talk about the five essential ingredients needed to creatively learn R and why these elements are also essential for advanced users to take their R skills to the next level. You will hear practical advice for when, where, and how to start a project in R, and how your learning can add value- both to your own knowledge and to contribute to the larger community of R learners. Along the way, she will share recommended resources and evidence-based strategies for project-based learning. Alison's background working with both new and advanced R users gives her a unique perspective on this topic.</p>

      <img src="../img/kara_woo.jpg" width="200">
      <p><strong>Title:</strong> Anyone Can Play Git/R: Tips for First-Time Contributions to R Packages</p>
      <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Kara Woo is a research scientist in data curation at Sage Bionetworks. She has a master's in library and information science from the University of Washington and is interested in data management, data visualization, and open and reproducible research. Kara is also a co-maintainer of accidental aRt, a blog of data visualizations gone beautifully wrong.</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Contributing to R packages and projects can be a rewarding way to give back to the tools you use and to improve your own programming skills in the process. In this talk, Kara will discuss some of the varied ways to contribute to existing projects. Anyone, whether a seasoned programmer or someone brand new to R, can make useful contributions to R packages. Kara will draw on her experience working on ggplot2 to offer strategies for finding your way in an unfamiliar codebase, and to give insights into the relationship between maintainers and contributors.</p>

      <h2>A gRadual intRoduction to Data Wrangling (Beginner)</h2>

      <p>Data comes in a variety of formats and even working with spreadsheet data can pose tricky problems. In this workshop, you'll use the `tidyverse` to transform messy data into nice summary tables and get a handle on dates, times, and strings as well. You'll find that using the `tidyverse`, it's easier to make and share reproducible data wrangling workflows that will increase your overall productivity. You might even have some fun doing it!</p>

      <p>An exploration into the `ggplot2` package. Focus will be on creating and tweaking basic plots while reviewing the underlying Grammar of Graphics throughout. You'll also see an easy way to turn many `ggplot2` graphics into dynamic plots with a simple function call.</p>

    <h1>cRaggy graphics show and tell</h1>
    <p>The first annual cRaggy graphics show-and-tell will be an informal event held during the Cascadia R Conf.  Everyone can participate by submitting an entry, by upvoting entries that you like, and by listening to the 3 lightning talks about the most popular entries at the end of the day.</p>

    <p>Everybody gets a look at one dataset (which might have more than one table), announced on Friday May 19 (about 2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website and in an email sent to everyone who’s pre-registered.  The dataset will <strong>not</strong> be mtcars or one of the usual suspects!  It will be public and easy-to-get-to, but relatively obscure and fun to play with. 
 </p>

    <p>On June 2, anybody can post an entry by 9 am, which consists of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One graph printed on 8 1/2” * 11” paper that explores the cRaggy dataset (which you can subset or augment with other data if you’d like)</li>
      <li>A URL pointing to the code that produced your graph (preferably on GitHub)</li>
      <li>Share your code in a print-out (or projecting it during a possible lighting talk)</li>
      <li>Contact info so you can be notified during the conference that you are invited to do a lighting talk</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All entries will be posted in a hallway where everyone can see, comment, and vote with a green cRaggy dot that you get at registration.  Votes will be counted after lunch, 3 speakers will be notified by 2 pm, and lighting talks will be around 4:30 pm. Each lighting talk will each be about 5 minutes, plus time to connect your computer to the projection screen.</p>
